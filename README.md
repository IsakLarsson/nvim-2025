# Neovim config
My new main Neovim config, my other one had gotten a bit bloated and rowdy so I thought I'd start over, remove some unused plugins, rework some keymaps and so forth.

## Try it out!

Assuming you already have `nvim` installed
```
mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.backup
git clone https://github.com/IsakLarsson/nvim-2025 ~/.config/nvim
```
